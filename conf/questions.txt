Q~1~That maze was tough. Glad I don't have to go in there again. But it has now lead me into an even stranger place.
 I see stuff appearing out of nowhere. Wait!, there are things that disappear too. Is this some kind of magic world?
 I wonder when I am going to disappear! I see a mansion. Wait!, there is smoke rising from far behind the mansion. Looks like the smoke is coming from a forest behind the mansion.
O~A.Go inside the mansion.
O~B.Ignore the mansion. Follow the road that leads to the smoke.
======================================
Q~2~This is a strange looking house. I wonder who would live in such a haunted place. Lets see if there is some one inside who can help me.
 Wait,What! How did that door open without me even touching it! Should I have gone for the smoke instead! Is this some kind of magic. Or is this place really haunted!
 Lets see. Nothing interesting in the ground floor. Perhaps I should check the basement or the top floor.
O~A.Check the top floor.
O~B.Check the basement.
======================================
Q~3~What is this place. Better check if I can find something useful. That carpet does not fit with the room. What does that note near the carpet say!
 "ONLY THE ONE WHO HAS KNOWLEDGE BE WORTHY TO FLY". What does that even mean. Does this carpet really fly.
O~A.Sit on the carpet
O~B.Go to the basement.
======================================
Q~4~Wow!! This carpet levitates in the air. Its moving forward. Out through the window. I see a giant statue on the ground. Or is that really just a statue?
 It does not resemble anything I have seen before. Is that some kind of animal? Resembles a warrior.
 The carpet seems to slow down. Why would this carpet take me in front of this cave? I wonder what creatures are in the inside. Should I go in?
 Even the carpet has left me alone here. I think its heading back home. I hope I could too somehow. Only if I knew where my home was.
O~A.Go inside the cave.
O~B.Return to the mansion.
======================================
Q~5~Its getting darker as I move inside. Lots of thick white ropes running throughout the cave. They form an enormous structure.
 There are objects stuck on them, like they are glued. I wonder what its purpose could be. What is that sound that I hear.
 Something is moving there. A giant spider. The entire structure was a giant spider web. The spsider is getting closer to me. I think that it wants to eat me.
O~A.Fight the spider.
O~B.Run away from the spider.
======================================
Q~6~This does not look good. I don't think I can hold on much longer. Better run away. But the monster is chasing me. I will have to run faster. It wont stop following me.
 May be if I get into the mansion it wont be able to catch me. Yeah. The beast cant reach me in here. Better check the basement of the house.
 I smell blood. There is something written on the ceiling. Looks like its been written in blood. Who would do that? "A WHISPER INTO THE MIGHTY SHALL MOVE IT".
 I get it. The statue! I should get to the statue.
O~A.Check the top floor to see if the carpet is there.
O~B.Trick the beast and run to the statue.
======================================
Q~7~The carpet has returned. Now that I have the knowledge of where I have to go, maybe it will take me to the statue. Lets try. Finally reached the statue.
 So I believe that I have to whisper to the statue. Lets try.
O~A.Whisper something to the left ear.
O~B.Whisper something to the right ear.
======================================
Q~8~Nothing has happened. Maybe I should try the other ear.
O~A.Whisper something to the right ear.
======================================
Q~9~Wow. The statue moves to the side. Looks like there is a secret tunnel below the statue. This could be my way out of this weird world. This is a narrow tunnel.
 I have reached a room. But this room leads to no where. May be there is another secret passage here somewhere. But all I can see is a pool of water.
 There is something written near by the pool. "THOSE WHO DRINK FROM THIS POOL SHALL HAVE ETERNITY". Having eternity is a real gift. Is this my destiny? Being eternal!
O~A.Better be sure. Check for secret passages in the room.
O~B.Drink from the pool
======================================
Q~10~I can't find any passages in this room.
O~A.Drink from the pool.
======================================
Q~11~The smoke looks further away than I had expected. That is a weird statue. It does not resemble anything I have seen before. Is that some kind of animal? Resembles a warrior.
 Guess I will have to move forward. Hmm. The road ends in front of a cave. Will there be someone inside the cave?
O~A.Go inside the cave.
O~B.Return to the mansion.
======================================
Q~12~I smell blood. There is something written on the roof. Looks like its been written in blood. Who would do that?
 "A WHISPER INTO THE MIGHTY SHALL MOVE IT." What does that even mean? Nothing more interesting here.
O~A.Go to the top floor
======================================
Q~13~It is a huge risk going into that cave. I don't even have a clue what could be inside it. Better return to the mansion. Wait! Where is the mansion? It was there a while ago.
 I can't see it anymore. How has it disappeared. What a strange place. Guess I have no other option.
O~A.Go inside the cave.
======================================
Q~14~This does not look good. I don't think I can fight this monster. Better run away. But the beast is chasing me. I will have to run faster. It wont stop following me.
 May be if I get into the mansion it wont be able to catch me. Yeah. The beast cannot reach me in here. Better check the basement of the house.
 The smell of blood reminds me of the message on the roof. "A WHISPER INTO THE MIGHTY SHALL MOVE IT".
 I get it. The statue! I should get to the statue.
O~A.Check the top floor to see if the carpet is there.
O~B.Trick the beast and run to the statue.
======================================
Q~15~The monster runs mad around the house. Probably frustrated of missing a meal. I will have to somehow distract it. May be I can create a fire.
 That should frighten the monster. Lucky we have lit candles here. But I wonder who would have kept them lit in here. But now is not the time to figure that out.
 I should escape this place. Yeah. The monster runs way being scared by the fire. Now I can safely follow the road to the statue.
 Better get there soon. So I believe I have to whisper to the statue. Lets try.
O~A.Whisper to the left ear.
O~B.Whisper to the right ear.
======================================
Q~16~What is this place. Better check if I can find something useful. That carpet does not fit with the rest of the room. What does that note near the carpet say!
 "ONLY THE ONE WHO HAS KNOWLEDGE BE WORTHY TO FLY". What does that even mean. Does this carpet really fly.
O~A.Sit on the carpet
